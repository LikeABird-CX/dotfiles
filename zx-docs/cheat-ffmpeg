# Convert M4A to MP3 using FFMPEG

You will need yo make sure that you have mp encoding enabled:

  $ ffmpeg -codecs help | grep 'mp3'

and then something like the following could furnish at least a starting point:

  $ ffmpeg -i input.m4a -acodec libmp3lame -ab 128k output.mp3

and the same as a batch-convertion (all files in folder at once) should look like this

  $ for f in *.m4a; do ffmpeg -i "$f" -acodec libmp3lame -ab 256k "${f%.m4a}.mp3"; done
